# SwiftUI Foundations

This project is inspired by Sean Allen’s [SwiftUI Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/@seanallen) series on YouTube.  
It focuses on understanding the **core concepts of SwiftUI**, building **custom views**, and writing **modular, reusable components**.

## 📚 Overview

The project covers:
- Building and structuring views using **SwiftUI**.
- Creating **custom reusable components** for clean code.
- Understanding **state management** and **bindings**.
- Applying **MVVM architecture** in small-scale SwiftUI projects.

Each section of the code is designed to help you grasp **how SwiftUI layouts work** and how to break them into smaller, composable units for better scalability and readability.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to design flexible UI components that can be reused across views.  
- How modifiers work under the hood in SwiftUI.  
- How to structure SwiftUI projects in a modular way.  
- The importance of writing declarative UI code that adapts to different states.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Used

- `@State` and `@Binding`
- `ViewBuilder`
- `ForEach`
- `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`
- Reusable custom views

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DJamesSmith/swiftui-foundations.git
2. Open the project in Xcode 15+.

3. Build and run on the simulator or a connected device.

💬 Notes

This project was recreated for learning purposes — to understand SwiftUI fundamentals by coding along and adding small customizations.

Keep building. Keep testing. Keep learning!

See you on the next one ✌
