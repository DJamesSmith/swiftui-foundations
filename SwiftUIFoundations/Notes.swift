 // MARK: Declarative and Imperative
 Imperative: In this methodology, you're specifically telling the UI what to look like all throughout the execution of your program.
 Two code paths:
 1. Logic: Change in Logic
 2. UI: Change in Data
 When your UI changes, you have to keep on updating it since they always have to be in sync.
 

 // MARK: Struct
 How SwiftUI uses "struct" for it's Views vs. classes for it's Views like in UIKit.
 UIButton for example. That inherits from UIView. Keyword is Inherits. Means UIButton has all the features & functionalities of a UIView that they probably dont need all of that. So there's a lot of bloat that gets inherited. That makes the classes a little more heavier.
 In SwiftUI, a struct can just conforms the View like there's no inheritance going on. So in SwiftUI, structs are super lightweight in perfromance. They get created, destroyed, re-rendered all the time in SwiftUI.
