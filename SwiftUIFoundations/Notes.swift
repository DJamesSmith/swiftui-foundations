 Declarative and Imperative
 Imperative: In this methodology, you;re specifically telling the UI what to look like all throughout the execution of your program.
 Two code paths:
 1. Logic: Change in Logic
 2. UI: Change in Data
 When your UI changes, you have to keep on updating it since they always have to be in sync.
